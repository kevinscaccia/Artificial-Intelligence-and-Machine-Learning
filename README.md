# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Implementations
Hello, I am **Kevin Scaccia** and here is some code I wrote during my studies of  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
Here you'll find both implementations using ML/DL libraries and my own implementations from scratch of some methods.
I hope to contribute  :smiley:
## Algorithms from Scratch
#### Classification
-  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) - [python](from_scratch/supervised_learning/classifiers/knn)
-  Naive Bayes for Twitter classification - [python](from_scratch/supervised_learning/classifiers/naive_bayes)
#### Artificial Neural Networks
- Simple Perceptron - [python](from_scratch/neural_networks/Perceptron/Perceptron.ipynb)
- Self Organizing Map (SOM Network) - [python](from_scratch/neural_networks/SOM_Network/SOM_Network.ipynb)
## Deep Learning With Keras
- Dense Image-Denoise Autoencoder - [python](deep_learning/denoise_autoencoder/ImageDenoise_Autoencoder.ipynb)
## Kaggle Problems 
- Network Intrusion Detection(Autoencoder Approach) [python](kaggle/network_intrusion_detection/Kaggle_Network_Intrusion_Detection.ipynb)

## Other Implementations
-  8-Puzzle Problem solver (Hill Climbing & Simulated Annealing) - from scratch [python](other/8_puzzle_problem/)
