# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Implementations
Hello, I am **Kevin Scaccia** and here is some code I wrote during my studies of  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
I hope to contribute  :smiley:

## Supervised Learning
### Classification 
-  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) [python](supervised_learning/classifiers/knn)
-  Naive Bayes for Twitter classification [python](supervised_learning/classifiers/naive_bayes)
### Regression 
-  Linear Regression (TO DO)
### Artificial Neural Networks
- Simple Perceptron - from scratch [python](neural_networks/Perceptron/Perceptron.ipynb)
- Multilayer Perceptron - from scratch (TO DO)
- Self Organizing Map (SOM Network) - from scratch [python](neural_networks/SOM_Network/SOM_Network.ipynb)
- Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) (TO DO)
### Genetic Algorithms
- TO DO
## Unsupervised Learning
- TO DO
## Other Implementations
-  8-Puzzle Problem solver (Hill Climbing & Simulated Annealing) [python](other/8_puzzle_problem/)
