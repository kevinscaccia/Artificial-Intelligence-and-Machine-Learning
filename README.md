# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Implementations
Hello, I am **Kevin Scaccia** and here is some code I wrote during my studies of  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
I hope to contribute  :smiley:

## Supervised Learning
### Classification 
-  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) [python](tree/master/classifiers/knn)
-  Naive Bayes for Twitter classification
### Regression 
-  Linear Regression
### Artificial Neural Networks
- MLP and Simple Perceptron  
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)
### Genetic Algorithms


## Unsupervised Learning
- TODO
## Other
